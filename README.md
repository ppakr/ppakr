## Hi there! I'm Akira ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ¤– I'm a Master's student in [Marine and Maritime Intelligent Robotics (MIR)](https://www.master-mir.eu/)  
ðŸ”§ I love learning and working with **robotics**, **control systems**, and **autonomous vehicles**  
â˜• When I'm not coding, I'm probably perfecting my latte art as a self-taught **home barista**

> Currently exploring ROS 2, underwater autonomy, and open-source tools for marine robotics.
